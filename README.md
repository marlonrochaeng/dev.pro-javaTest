Automating a 5G Router: Innovating for Connectivity

I used the Robot Framework for a 5G router set to launch in South America and potentially Europe by year-end. We automated both front-end and back-end processes, ensuring a stable and interesting experience for end-users and telecom companies. Every new week we had a stable release with bug fixes and at the end of the next 2 weeks, a release with new features.

Our tests covered everything from basic logins to advanced configurations, catering to diverse user needs. We rigorously tested with various devices, manual and automated, to ensure compatibility and performance across the board.

Despite challenges, our collaborative approach and innovation drove success. I'm excited to see the impact of our work as this technology reaches users, revolutionizing connectivity across continents.
